## What?

**Universal Tape** is an open standard mortgage note tape format. The format enriches mortgage note tapes with a consistent naming structure and data types.

---

## Why?

The industry has stagnated growth by not adopting a consistent tape format. Some of the issues we have noticed are:

* Investors are confused by the inconsistent naming conventions from one note tape to another.
* No central documentation for understanding the different data points in a note tape.
* Import/export of data between systems/applications has become nearly impossible.
* Tooling, templates etc for note tapes is non-existent.

All of this has led to the development of **Universal Tape**.

## How?

### Investors

Export your tapes from your tape provider _(servicer, management app, etc)_ in **Universal Tape** format. If they do not offer a **Universal Tape** export option, make sure to point them to this website.

In the meantime, you can manually tweak your tape to match the format defined in the [spec](/spec). Then you can seamlessly work with other systems that integrate with **Universal Tape**.  This will also allow you to provide a consistent, well-documented format that is easy to understand for other investors that you share your tape with.

### Tape Providers

Start implementing a **Universal Tape** workflow into your product! The format is an open standard, and we'd love to get your input. All work is being done on our [Github](https://github.com/UniversalTape).
